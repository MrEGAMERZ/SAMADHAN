# SAMADHAN — Production-Ready Master Plan

## What You're Building

**SAMADHAN** is a **Governance Intelligence Platform** — an AI-powered civic grievance redressal system that connects **Citizens**, **Ward Officials (MLA)**, **District Collectors**, and **Members of Parliament** in a tiered accountability loop.

```

### Core Innovation
- **AI Triage**: Gemini-powered complaint categorization + criticality scoring (0-100 scale, 6-tier levels)
- **Star Priority System**: Dynamic 1-5 star rating combining AI score + community upvotes
- **Auto-Escalation**: Breached deadlines automatically reassign up the tier chain with halved response windows
- **Accountability Score**: Officials gain/lose points based on resolution speed and citizen verification
- **Citizen Verification Loop**: Citizens vote on whether resolutions are real — false closures penalize officials

## Proposed Changes

### Phase 1 — Critical Backend Fixes

> [!CAUTION]
> These must be fixed before anything else. The app will crash without them.

#### [MODIFY] [main.py](file:///c:/Users/mdawa/OneDrive/Desktop/codes/H2K/backend/main.py)
- Add `from dotenv import load_dotenv; load_dotenv()` at the top so `.env` variables are actually loaded
- After `create_complaint` in complaints route, call `app.state.notify_clients()` to trigger real-time WebSocket broadcasts
- Add a `@app.on_event("startup")` handler for scheduled escalation sweeps using `asyncio`

#### [MODIFY] [escalation.py](file:///c:/Users/mdawa/OneDrive/Desktop/codes/H2K/backend/services/escalation.py)
- Replace `from sqlalchemy.orm import Session` with `from database import get_db` compatible import
- The function signature uses `Session` type hint — change to use the MongoDB session adapter

#### [MODIFY] [routing.py](file:///c:/Users/mdawa/OneDrive/Desktop/codes/H2K/backend/services/routing.py)
- Same `sqlalchemy.orm` import fix as escalation.py
- Replace `Session` type hints with MongoDB-compatible session

#### [MODIFY] [requirements.txt](file:///c:/Users/mdawa/OneDrive/Desktop/codes/H2K/backend/requirements.txt)
- Remove `sqlalchemy` (no longer used with MongoDB)
- Add `python-jose[cryptography]` for real JWT tokens
- Add `passlib[bcrypt]` for password hashing
- Add `apscheduler` for background escalation sweeps

---

### Phase 2 — Authentication & Security Hardening

#### [NEW] `backend/auth/jwt_handler.py`
- Real JWT token generation and validation using `python-jose`
- Token expiry (24 hours for citizens, 8 hours for officials)
- Password hashing with bcrypt instead of plaintext `"password"` comparison

#### [MODIFY] [auth.py](file:///c:/Users/mdawa/OneDrive/Desktop/codes/H2K/backend/routes/auth.py)
- Use real JWT token generation instead of fake string tokens
- Hash passwords on official creation, verify with bcrypt on login
- Add `get_current_user` dependency for protected routes

#### [NEW] `src/services/authGuard.jsx`
- React component wrapping `<Outlet>` that checks `localStorage` for valid token
- Redirects to `/login/citizen` or `/login/official` if not authenticated
- Prevents direct URL navigation to protected routes

#### [MODIFY] [App.jsx](file:///c:/Users/mdawa/OneDrive/Desktop/codes/H2K/src/App.jsx)
- Wrap Citizen, Official, MLA, and MP route groups with `<AuthGuard>` component

- Community upvote leaderboard showing top complaints in their ward

#### [NEW] `src/pages/CitizenAnalytics.jsx` + `CitizenAnalytics.css`
Citizen-facing analytics dashboard:
- Personal complaint timeline (visual chart of filed vs resolved over time)
- Ward-level statistics: How their ward compares to others
- Average resolution time for their complaints
- Reward points history and breakdown
- Verification status summary (how many verified, how many false closures caught)

#### [MODIFY] [CitizenIssues.jsx](file:///c:/Users/mdawa/OneDrive/Desktop/codes/H2K/src/pages/CitizenIssues.jsx)
- Add search/filter functionality (by status, category, date range)
- Add verification action buttons: When a complaint is `PENDING_VERIFICATION`, show "YES it's fixed" / "NO it's not" buttons
- Connect upvote functionality so citizens can upvote other ward complaints

#### [MODIFY] [CitizenReport.jsx](file:///c:/Users/mdawa/OneDrive/Desktop/codes/H2K/src/pages/CitizenReport.jsx)
- Wire up the **real Web Speech API** (`window.SpeechRecognition`) instead of the fake typing animation
- Add actual file upload for photos using `FormData` + a new backend upload endpoint
- Use browser Geolocation API to auto-detect lat/lng instead of hardcoded coordinates
- Add success animation and redirect to "My Issues" after filing

---

### Phase 4 — Complete the Official Portal

- Wire the "Authorize DPR" and "Export PDF" buttons to real actions

#### [NEW] `backend/routes/projects.py`
- GET `/api/projects` — list all development projects ranked by priority
- POST `/api/projects/generate` — AI-powered project generation from clustered complaints (using Gemini)

---

### Phase 5 — Real-Time Features & Notifications

#### [MODIFY] [complaints.py](file:///c:/Users/mdawa/OneDrive/Desktop/codes/H2K/backend/routes/complaints.py)
- After `create_complaint()` succeeds, call `request.app.state.notify_clients("NEW_COMPLAINT", {...})` to broadcast to all connected WebSocket clients

---

### Phase 8 — Deployment Readiness

#### [NEW] `Dockerfile` (root)
```dockerfile
# Multi-stage build: Build frontend → Serve with backend
FROM node:20-alpine AS frontend
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

FROM python:3.11-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY backend/ ./backend/
COPY --from=frontend /app/dist ./dist/
RUN pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
CMD ["python", "backend/main.py"]
```

#### [MODIFY] [main.py](file:///c:/Users/mdawa/OneDrive/Desktop/codes/H2K/backend/main.py)
- Add `StaticFiles` mount to serve the built Vite frontend from `/dist`
- Add catch-all route for SPA client-side routing (serve `index.html` for any non-API route)
- Set CORS origins to specific domains in production (not `"*"`)

#### [NEW] `render.yaml` (deployment configuration for Render)
- Web service configuration for the Python backend
- Build command, start command, environment variables
- MongoDB Atlas connection string as environment variable

#### [MODIFY] [vite.config.js](file:///c:/Users/mdawa/OneDrive/Desktop/codes/H2K/vite.config.js)
- Add proxy configuration for `/api` routes to backend during development
- Configure output directory and chunk splitting for production builds

#### [NEW] `.env.example`
- Template showing all required environment variables with placeholder values
- Documentation comments explaining each variable

---

### Phase 9 — Business & Legal Compliance

> [!CAUTION]
> To ensure the platform is "legally perfect" and ideas are protected for the hackathon and beyond, we must implement proper legal frameworks.

#### [NEW] `LICENSE`
- Choose an appropriate software license to protect the codebase.
- We will default to a **Proprietary/Closed Source License** to protect the IP ("ideas are perfect") before the hackathon presentation, preventing unauthorized use or copying. We can switch to Open Source (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0) later if required by the government.

#### [NEW] `PRIVACY_POLICY.md` & `TERMS_OF_SERVICE.md`
- Since the application collects citizen phone numbers, GPS locations, and potentially sensitive grievance data, we must have clear policies.
- Outline data retention, user consent (GDPR/DPDP India compliance), and terms of usage.

#### [NEW] `CONFIDENTIALITY.md`
- Add a confidentiality notice or "Patent Pending" style disclaimer to protect the novel ideas (like the tiered escalation and verification loop) from being stolen by other teams or unauthorized parties prior to official submission.

#### [MODIFY] All Source Code Files
- Inject a standard Copyright and Confidentiality Header into all critical `.py`, `.jsx`, and `.js` files asserting ownership by Team H2K.

#### [NEW] Dependency License Audit
- The current dependencies (`react`, `vite`, `fastapi`, `pymongo`, etc.) are permissively licensed (MIT, BSD, Apache). We will add an automated checker to ensure no viral GPL dependencies are introduced in the future that could force open-sourcing of proprietary ideas.

---

## Open Questions

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These decisions will affect the implementation. Please review:

1. **Software License**: Do you want to keep the codebase entirely **Proprietary/Closed Source** for now to protect your ideas, or do you want to release it under an **Open Source** license (like MIT or Apache 2.0)?
2. **Entity Name**: For the legal documents (Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, Copyright headers), should I use "Team H2K", "Government of Jharkhand", or a specific company name as the legal entity?
3. **Data Retention Policy**: How long should we legally state that we keep citizen data (e.g., phone numbers, locations) after a complaint is resolved? (Standard is 1-3 years or upon user deletion request).
4. **Gemini API Key**: Your `.env` currently has `GEMINI_API_KEY=` (empty). Do you have a key to provide? Without it, the AI engine falls back to keyword-based rules, which still works but is less impressive for demos.
5. **MongoDB Atlas vs Local**: For deployment, should I configure MongoDB Atlas (cloud-hosted, free tier available) or do you plan to run MongoDB on your own server?
6. **Real OTP Service**: Currently using hardcoded `"123456"`. Do you want me to integrate a real SMS OTP provider (e.g., Twilio, MSG91) or keep the mock OTP for now?
7. **File Upload Storage**: For complaint photos and resolution evidence, should I use local file storage (simpler) or integrate a cloud storage provider (e.g., Cloudinary, AWS S3)?
8. **Branding**: The app alternates between "VANTA", "CivicPulse", and "CivicPulse Governance" across different pages. Which brand name should be the canonical one everywhere?

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
```bash
# Backend API tests
python -m pytest backend/tests/ -v

# Frontend build validation
npm run build

# Lint checks
npm run lint
```

### Manual Verification
- [ ] Citizen registers via OTP → lands on Home page with real stats
- [ ] Citizen files complaint with voice → AI categorizes → appears in DB
- [ ] Official sees complaint in dashboard → clicks View Ticket → sees citizen profile
- [ ] Official marks IN_PROGRESS → citizen's "My Issues" shows updated status
- [ ] Official submits resolution → citizen sees PENDING_VERIFICATION
- [ ] Citizen votes YES → complaint moves to RESOLVED → official score increases
- [ ] Citizen votes NO → complaint reopens → official score decreases
- [ ] Overdue complaint auto-escalates from MLA → Collector → MP
- [ ] LiveMap shows real pins with color-coded criticality
- [ ] WebSocket broadcasts update the map in real-time
- [ ] MP sees constituency-wide analytics and priority ranker with real data
- [ ] All pages render correctly on mobile (375px width)
- [ ] `npm run build` produces zero errors
- [ ] Docker container starts and serves full app on port 8000
